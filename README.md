## CREATE A PREDICTIVE MODEL USING SCIKIT-LEARN TO CLASSIFY OR PREDICT OUTCOMES FROM A DATASET (E.G., SPAM EMAIL DETECTION).
##Objective:
To build a predictive model that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam).

To apply basic machine learning techniques for text classification using real-world data.
##Tools & Technologies Used:
Python – core language for development

Pandas – data loading and preprocessing

Scikit-learn – model building, training, and evaluation

TfidfVectorizer – feature extraction from text

Jupyter Notebook – interactive development environment


##Conclusion:
The machine learning model effectively classifies SMS messages with good accuracy. This project demonstrates the practical use of natural language processing and classification algorithms to solve real-world problems like spam detection.
